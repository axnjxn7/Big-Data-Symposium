She made everything so simple and her coordination with the sellers agent was world class. Not to mention he smile that lights up the room. It is rare to find such positive people in the real estate world. I'd like to add that Krista is an amazing negotiator too. I will definitely recommend Mimi and Friends to my friends and family.

From start to finish Mimi and Krista were absolutely fantastic. 
My husband and I were in the process of selling our home in Las Vegas, Nevada and new we wanted to move to Tampa, Florida.  However, we were unsure of where in Tampa we would like to move. From the start Mimi video chatted with us, got to know our likes and dislikes and filled us in on how the process would go. She got us linked up with Krista, a beautiful soul both inside and out. Both Krista and Mimi kept in touch with us over months, checking in to see how our home was doing in Vegas and ensuring that we felt confident that when we sold we would find the PERFECT home for us. 
They were so RIGHT, and when we found a home we liked, Krista was absolutely willing to go and show us via zoom. We did a walk through of the home and loved it, she gave her honest opinion based off of what she had seen in our likes and dislikes over the previous months. She and Mimi and friends ensured that we were linked up with a equally awesome mortgage company and streamlined the buying process as painless as possible. Although, there is always some pains, Krista and Mimi were responsive, honest and open about the whole thing. Additionally, this was a quick sell as the sellers were eager to meet a timeline of their own. Krista, Mimi and the whole team were simply amazing. It was a true BLESSING to work with them all. Thank you Krista and Mimi!"

The process was very very slow , while all the time jumping thru the hoops of Bank Statements and Paycheck stubs every week.
I started to question if the loan officer knew what she was doing on several levels.
I contacted the Chief loan officer to let her know did not have  much confidence in her abilities to process my mortgage loan, she reassured me that the loan officer was experienced and knew what she was doing.
I was not convinced!
I recently received a notice from State Farm Insurance that my Homeowners Policy was being cancelled.
I contacted Third Federal S & L and they told me that it was there business practice to not escrow for insurance, just taxes.
I have never heard that before I have had several mortgages throughout my life (I am 62) so this is not my first rodeo with mortgage companies.
My taxes and insurance always came from escrow that was part of my payment.
I would advise anyone seeking a mortgage or re-finance look elsewhere anywhere but Third Federal Savings and Loan they do not tell you that you have to come up with $3000.00 each year for homeowners insurance.
That's absurd and very poor (Business Practice)"

However, if you're used to a modern banking experience you're going to be extremely disappointed.
I was deployed overseas when my mother unexpectedly passed away.  She had a checking account and a CD with 3rd Federal; the checking had my sister on the account and I was apparently on the CD.  Florida has archaic laws regarding probate, which requires us to wait months before we can sell her house, meanwhile we have to continue to pay electricity, water and her HOA.
Trying to cash out this CD was the most painful experience ever.  My husband several states over has a general POA; when I first called this bank they said I just needed to send a letter of intent and they would send me a check.  Then it turned into my husband had to send the ORIGINAL POA, sign a bunch of forms, wait for them to get them, send more forms, have me send forms from the Middle East...it was like 10 forms they wanted.  Luckily my sister called, convinced them to just take a photocopy, and I sent them a picture of my driver's license and a letter saying my husband had my permission to cash out the CD.  Um, do they not know what a POA is for?  This took over a month just to get to this point.  They said they were not set up to do a bank wire transfer (who doesn't offer electronic bill pay?!) and so sent us a check.  They sent an over $5k check with no tracking number.  It took about 10 days to get it.
Thankfully I live nowhere near this bank and use a bank that offers modern amenities.  I have no idea what my parents were thinking using this one."

CARSON WRIGHT -The only name you need to know when it comes to getting a loan to buy a home or flood insurance. Carson works for Butler Mortgage - Powered By The Mortgage Firm.

I tried the bank where I had my savings and checking accounts for a home loan but they were soooo slow it was irritating and their interest rate was high.

When I needed a home loan, Carson was recommended to me by my Century 21 real estate agent Janelle Makowski, herself a 5 star agent. I was not used to dealing with home loans over the internet. I'm an ""in person"" guy and dislike much modern technology as I do not even own a cell phone, I have a landline. But Carson made it a breeze.

He informed me in writing and on the phone of what I needed to do. There were times that I was stumped as to how to proceed on viewing papers via the computer and he took me by the hand and led me through it step by step. We came upon obstacles and he cleared the way for me. Carson did not object to me visiting him in his office in St. Petersburg to hand him papers or sign documents that I was not tech savvy enough to do over the net. He always reminded me he was there for me for help.

Carson called me almost daily to check on my progress, sent emails regularly and offered his assistance at any time. Are you ready for this -- He called me on Saturdays and Sundays to help me and was available to me even at 9 pm at night!

Here's the bottom line: Carson got me a 2.99% loan and set me up with a company for homeowner's insurance that beat most of the competition by $500 to $1000 a year.

Carson is professional, knowledgeable, experienced, personable and best of all the most hard working and available loan officer imaginable.

It was really like working with best friends. I can't say enough about how lucky I feel to have chosen them to process our reverse mortgage. So much better than dealing with cold uncaring non family owned companies who couldn't care less about you. They made sure before sending the loan to the underwriters it would be perfect and it was. Quick and easy with no delays. Such a great family owned company!

Their Broker Connie Walker went on vacation and even though i talked to her during vacation and then waited for the pre-approval after she got back she still didn't know what shes doing and during a contract she wants you to stop all inspections and everything 12 Hrs before because she hasnt done her job and now their clients money is at risk but never mind how the buyers hopes and dreams AND HOME are gone now too but they don't care about that because they don't know their own job so why would they care about what's going on with you I strongly suggest that you do not use this company. They say you don't need closing costs and you do. I had 5 %  for the client and then said he didn't need them so they were taken off to win the deal.....then contacted today to say we need them or he needs to wait 60 days to get his score up for the program she said he qualified for before and now doesnt. You get your hopes up just to be let down because their brokers are not upfront  or don't care. Even messaging Barry Horvath about his broker didn't initiate any response even though he read the messages...he chooses to ignore hoping for it to go away...but when someone who fought for this country was lied to and now homeless  in 20 days with his father in law dead the same week...and the problem ignored by barry horvath, someone who ran for office....I have a big problem with that..my client and veteran will be homeless in 20 days...how horrible for him and also shame on the company who built him up just to shut him down with a lack of work ethic and mis-truths. What a joke and my buyer will be out money too. Don't trust everyone who says they have your back! Look what just happened due to ""needing a vacation during peak season"" If you don't want to work during the season..don't complain about having any customers ..take vacations when everyone else who's busy does...during Halloween to Christmas."

It's so evident she loves what she does and it's exactly the reason I wanted to work with her when I was ready to buy my own home. I reached out to her and her team two years ago to find out where I should start in the process. I was given solid advice that I worked hard to implement. 

When I was ready, so were they! Morgan Gall, my lender, was able to get me approved, rather quickly.  Every question I had (& there were plenty!) was answered completely and thoroughly to my full understanding. Then the hunt began! I prepared myself for a lengthy search although I was hopeful with each listing we visited. 

Meagan listened to my bizarre logic on laundry room locations and respected my intuition when I didn't dig specific houses. She paid attention to my style, my needs and the little things I wanted in a home and when the house that ultimately became my home popped up on her phone - mins after being listed! - her instincts immediately started tingling. She had a feeling this could be ""the one"", without even showing me a single picture we drove over as quickly as we could and within minutes WE knew! I'm so incredibly grateful for her insight and attentiveness. She was a steller agent from start to finish. Her communication throughout was consistent, clear, professional and prompt, something that is so important to me! I will recommend her indefinitely! 

This has been such a wonderful experience as a first time home buyer. I appreciate how you took the time to help me understand each step of the process and inform me of all my options along the way. Thank you so much for helping me get into MY HOME!"

From: John Warner 
Topic: Mortgage Processing with JP Morgan Chase (Big Bank) vs. a Reputable Mortgage Bank 

My wife, Kathy and I, decided to buy a condo in Redington Shores, Florida since one of our daughters lives in St. Petersburg and we have no reason to stay in Dublin, Ohio in the winter.  I was going to pay cash for the condo, as we have for our other 2 homes, but the Real Estate company that I invest in reminded me that they pay 10% and I could get the loan for about 4%.

Without thinking, I went to JP Morgan Chase where I bank and have a preferred ""Private Banking"" relationship.  What I discovered during the process should NOT be repeated by anyone.  These points, as I found out, apply to most or all multidiscipline large banks.

Major Points of the Process Included:

* An inordinate number of arcane rules in addition to stifling interpretation of regulatory rules such as Dodd-Frank, etc.
* As an example, I receive about $800K a year from my investments.  I don't usually pay taxes unless they sell and I end up with capital gains taxes.  Even my real estate holdings have sold at about 2X and cover my capital gains with gains in cash and equity to re-invest.  Chase said ""we don't recognize revenue unless you pay taxes on it"".  All of my income was non-taxable but shows up on my K-1's as capital distributions.  As a result, with a multiple of 8 digits in net worth and 800+ credit rating, they decided that they could only lend me 65% of the purchase price.
* In addition, I set up an LLC and had that wholly owned by a revocable living trust to keep anonymity over the purchase.
*  Because this is not their main business, I ended up dealing with 9 groups at Chase including 2 attorneys, the mortgage banker, 4 levels of underwriting and approval, the actual system processing group (for whom I had to help fix a bug in their system) and yet another level of QA in the process.  This resulted in:
o 9 delays in the closing date
o Extremely displeased sellers who threatened to back out and go with another offer
o Additional personal expense and frustration with process
o A .05% interest rate increase associated with the delays and market rates
o Groups who asked for the same information, did not communicate with each other, had different assumptions, and, in short were purely dysfunctional in this process
o At one point I said ""This process was more painful that my father's funeral"" and I meant it.
What I would suggest to any one in need of a mortgage loan, is working with a highly reputable, single discipline Mortgage Bank, period.  Their only business is the origination and funding of mortgages and their reputation and future is completely based on the client's satisfaction, BBB rating, reviews, etc.

Let's Look at Guaranteed Rate  https://www.guaranteedrate.com.  As pointed out below they are a top 10 lender nationwide with an A+ Better Business Bureau review and a 95+% Customer Satisfaction Rating. These numbers are incredible for a mortgage banker.  If you look at the reviews, this is their total business and their process is streamlined, easy and professional.  
I chose them for this comparison because of their rating and Wikipedia.org's glowing review:
Awards and accolades[edit]
* Guaranteed Rate recognized as one of the most successful private companies in the U.S. for a fifth consecutive year by Inc. Magazine
* Guaranteed Rate named a top private U.S. job creator by Inc. Magazine
* Guaranteed Rate ranked as a top workplace by the Chicago Tribune in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015
* Guaranteed Rate was named the Lender of the Year by Chicago Agent Magazine
* Founder and CEO, Victor Ciardelli, III was named an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award winner in 2012
* Better Business Bureau A+ Rating
* Guaranteed Rate wins Moxie Award For Best Corporate Digital Innovation 2013 for Guaranteed Rate's Online Mortgage App






 

Furthermore, if you look at Today's rates, Guaranteed Rate can meet or beat JP Morgan's rates and do it in 1/3 the time and with an infinitely simpler and easier process.



If you want more proof, talk to any Realtor.  I have since talked to a few and they all tell me the same thing.   


Sincerely,
 
John T. Warner"

I just want to start that this is my second loan with this bank and have had the pleasure of working with Laurie both times. She has the BEST customer service. She explains things so well and makes the process painless. She gets everything done quickly and efficiently without feeling rushed. I work 9-5 and am not able to go into the office so we emailed and spoke over the phone for the whole process. She is dedicated to giving the best customer service as well as making you feel that choosing Florida Central is a great choice. I am 21 and still trying to understand the ins and outs of loans and warranties and all of that. (My dad friend explaining but it made me even more confused) when Laurie explained how the process works I felt confident in my choice of choosing Florida Central, yet again for my loan. Laurie works with your schedule and has a great response time! If you want quality service and actually understand what is going on when it comes to your loan, definitely chose the Seminole Branch Florida Central Credit Union and ask for Laurie! You will feel safe and secure with this decision, I promise!!

We met Diane Schillace at a home show.  We had tried to refinance our Palm Harbor home through Suntrust and it was a horrible experience.  Diane felt confident she could help us.  Piece of cake.  So when it was time to sell our home and buy a condo, we went straight to Diane.  OJ Mortgage really supports her - when she went on vacation, her manager stepped in and kept the process going.  And I cannot say enough about Dee Norris, her loan processor.  Dee is like a bull dog - just pushing through until every detail is taken care of.  Only ding I would give them is they need to set up a way to securely send documents.  I got around it by putting them on my OneDrive and sharing that folder with just them."

These trusted professionals treated me with the outmost respect from the first moment I applied.  I was not a favorable candidate to embark on homeownership--or so I thought.  Jill and Mark diligently worked with me throughout the process.  I needed to meet my goals as far as mortgage and financing based on my budget.  They ran with it and had me approved without losing sight of my goals and never compromising my position.  We encountered a few obstacles, specifically condo associations.  Jill and Mark never made me feel that they were spending too much time on my case--though I know they did.  They treated me as if I was their most important client.  I am now a homeowner thanks to their great efforts.  Kudos to Gateway Capital Mortgage for hiring such amazing people.  I highly recommend Jill Statz and Mark Halim on your journey.  You want trusted and knowledgeable professionals like them to guide you through this process.  They are the only ones I will ever consult for future purchases or loans.
Thank you!!!!!
